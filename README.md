# Arturo's Emacs configuration

This is my emacs config is made with literate programming.
If you want to check my config a good starting point is the 
config.org file, so you understand what every piece of code does
or why is there. Or if you want to jump straight to the code
the init.el is there.

TODO: split configuration in individual files.
